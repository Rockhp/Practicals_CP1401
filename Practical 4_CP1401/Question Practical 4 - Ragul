What is the PyCharm keyboard shortcut for commenting (out/in) a selection of code? - Ctrl+/
What are the two kinds of loops available in Python? - while loop and for loop
What is a "sentinel" (when dealing with loops)? - A sentinel value is a special value used to terminate a loop when reading data.
What is wrong with this variable name: nothingWrong - should be nothing_wrong so easier to read.
What are augmented assignment operators? - Augmented Assignment Operators are used to replace those statements where binary operator takes two operands says var1 and var2 and then assigns a final result back to one of operands

Loop outputs
#1. 0 1 2 3 4 5
#2. 33 34 35 36 37 38
#3. 17 16 15 14 13 12
#4. 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
#5. 100>64>36>16>4>

Range values
#1. range(6)
#2. range(1, 14, 4)
#3. range(3, 0, -1)
#4. range(7, -6, -3)

Patterns
Error-checking user input, looping until they enter a valid response - while loop
A menu with several options including 'quit' - while loop
Displaying all of the months in a year - for loop
Printing 5 random numbers - for loop
Printing n random numbers, where n is a user input - while loop

Logic Exercise

As every box is incorrectly labeled
First take out the ball from the bag labeled BW. If The ball comes out to be black, it implies that there are 2 black balls in that bag.
And then the bag labeled WW can have either BW or WW but as all are incorrectly labeled, it implies it has BW
And the third bag contains 2 WW balls
